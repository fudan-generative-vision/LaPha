{"question": "Points $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{N}$ are equally spaced around the circumference of a circle and $N \\geq 3$. Three of these points are selected at random and a triangle is formed using these points as its vertices.\n\nThrough this solution, we will use the following facts:\n\nWhen an acute triangle is inscribed in a circle:\n\n- each of the three angles of the triangle is the angle inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended,\n- each of the three arcs into which the circle is divided by the vertices of the triangles is less than half of the circumference of the circle, and\n- it contains the centre of the circle.\n\nWhy are these facts true?\n\n- Consider a chord of a circle which is not a diameter.\n\nThen the angle subtended in the major arc of this circle is an acute angle and the angle subtended in the minor arc is an obtuse angle.\n\nNow consider an acute triangle inscribed in a circle.\n\nSince each angle of the triangle is acute, then each of the three angles is inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended.\n\n- It follows that each arc of the circle that is outside the triangle must be a minor arc, thus less than the circumference of the circle.\n- Lastly, if the centre was outside the triangle, then we would be able to draw a diameter of the circle with the triangle entirely on one side of the diameter.\n\n<image_1>\n\nIn this case, one of the arcs of the circle cut off by one of the sides of the triangle would have to be a major arc, which cannot happen, because of the above.\n\nTherefore, the centre is contained inside the triangle.\nIf $N=7$, what is the probability that the triangle is acute?

{"question": "An $\\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.
